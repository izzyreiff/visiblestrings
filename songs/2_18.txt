In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying, trying to make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times, but I'm not pickin' up
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said, "Leave", but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride, sittin' here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over the things we both said
And I remember the slammin' door and all the things that I misread
So, babe, if you know everything, tell me, why you couldn't see
That when I left, I wanted you to chase after me? Yeah
I said, "Leave", but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
And I scream out the window, I can't even look at you
I don't need you, but I do, I do, I do
I said, "There's nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it, I mean it, " but what I mean is
I said, "Leave", but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window, throwing pebbles
Screaming, "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, come back for more
And don't you leave, 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carry me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything, I must confess I need you
